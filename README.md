# JournalPost

JournalPost is an environmentally-conscious postcard app to journal your travel experiences through your own digital, custom postcards.

This project was created for the capstone of the Flatiron School's Full-Stack Software Engineering Immersive. It was created after completing 15 weeks of Ruby/Rails, JavaScript/React/Redux.

This application utilizes a Rails backend API, which can be found [here](https://github.com/leannemcabey/journal_post_api).
